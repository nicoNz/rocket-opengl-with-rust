# rocket-opengl-with-rust
Putting some libs togetger to create interctive visuals and learn rust at the same time

This projet is highly inspired from openFrameworks and follow some guildelines provided by this tutorial https://github.com/Nercury/rust-and-opengl-lessons.
Ideally, this program should allow a programmer to describe a graphic app with wrapped functions for describing a 3D scene, manage materials, and interact with visuals with a front web application. 
Any 3D objects, materials and scene utilities such as cameras and light can be described, created and created with a json file.
